        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>In this HTML document, I have structured my resume content within a clearly defined tag, making it semantically appropriate for representing self-contained compositions. The use of <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags for each section heading (Objective, Skills, Certifications, Education, Experience, Projects) ensures proper document structure and readability. Each section is further organized with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags for paragraphs and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tags for lists, which provide a clean and accessible format. The design choices for this document include the following: Font choices of Arial, sans-serif for a modern look and readability; heading sizes with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> at 2.5em and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> at 1.75em; main text size at 1em for a balance between readability and information density; color choices including background color #f4f4f4, text color #333, heading color #2c3e50, and footer background color #2c3e50 with text color #fff; margin and padding choices with zero document margins, 20px padding around sections for visual separation, 20px padding at the top and 10px at the bottom for headings, and a bottom margin of 10px for list items for separation.</p>
